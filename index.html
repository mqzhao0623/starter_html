            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width="400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <p>Cody is a 7yr old Pembroke Corgi. He was born in Cavalier Farms, Seattle. He prefers to spend his days
                lounging on the bean bag. Every day, he enjoys two walks around the neighborhood and likes to make
                friends with other
                doggie friends. If lucky enough, he might see the cyclist, but he is not allowed to give chase.
            </p>
            <p>Cody loves traveling. He enjoys walking on the beach and taking sun naps. But he hates cold weather. He
                would like to stay at home lounging by the fireplace in winter.</p>

            <p>With a coat as dark as midnight but eyes as bright as stars, he seemed to embody both the mystery and the
                exuberance of life itself. Agile and playful, he danced around the park as if the grass were his
                personal stage, captivating everyone with his vivacity. </p>
            <p>Yet, when at home, Chako transformed into a zen master. He would curl up on his favorite rug, eyes
                half-closed in contemplation, as if solving the great puzzles of the universe. Both spirited and serene,
                Mochi was a living testament to the richness of dualities, teaching his human companions that one could
                be many
                things all at once.

            <h2>Rocket</h2>
            <img src="images/Huiyu%20Su/rocket_childhood.jpg" width="400" alt="Cute, small and yellow pomeranian">

            <p>
                Rocket (also named huihui) is a 6-month pomeranian puppy with big eyes and a small, black cute nose.
                Rocket is named
                rocket because he runs so fast and energetic all day without even having some rest. Rocket loves to
                carry his little
                toy walking around the house and jumping towards my bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rocket is friendly to all human beings. He will be a little shy at first, but will 'say hi to you after
                a few
                seconds. He is also friendly to dogs, especially the small breed, because the large size dogs are hard
                for him to
                smell lol. If you meet rocket, don't hesitate to say hi to him!! He will be super happy the whole day.
            </p>
